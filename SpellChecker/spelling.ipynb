For example, if this was a text messenger, and the user frequently sent \"Hey, how are you?\" then that would become a more likely correction if the user accidentally typed something such as \"Heu, hoq are you?\" as opposed to an incorrect correction like \"Hen, hot are you?\". All that needs to be done is change the boolean value in the sentenceCorrectB() function to True and it will start appending to the file and then just update Dictionary and it will have the most recent changes."

I would also change how it keeps track of the words that are commonly used after each word. Right now it is simply a queue of the past n words that were used which works but takes up a lot of space. Lastly, how it decides which word to pick could also be improved but as I already mentioned, I would need better testing in order to figure out how to best improve it."
